# Decentralized Language Learning Platform

This project implements a decentralized language learning platform using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. The platform allows language learners to connect with native speakers for conversation practice, manages scheduling and payments, and includes a reputation system with token rewards.

## Smart Contracts

The platform consists of the following smart contracts:

1. `language-learning-token.clar`: Implements the Language Learning Token (LLT)
2. `user-registry.clar`: Manages user registration and reputation
3. `session-management.clar`: Handles session creation and management
4. `payment-handler.clar`: Manages payments for sessions
5. `reward-system.clar`: Distributes rewards and updates user reputations

## Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet): A Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (for running tests)
